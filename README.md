PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Farmers encounter significant challenges in selecting the most suitable crops each season, with soil conditions playing a critical role in determining growth and yield. Since each crop thrives under specific soil parameters, we address this issue by applying machine learning techniques. A multi-class classification model has been developed to predict the optimal crop choice based on soil measurements.


DATA

The dataset utilized in this project is titled soil_measures.csv and includes the following attributes:

N: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil

P: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil

K: Potassium content ratio in the soil

pH: Acidity/alkalinity level of the soil

crop: Target variable representing categorical crop types

The dataset has been thoroughly preprocessed and is now structured for application in machine learning models.
